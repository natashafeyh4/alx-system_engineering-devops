# Postmortem Project Summary

## Overview
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and focuses on writing a postmortem for a web stack debugging issue or outage. The goal is to analyze the incident, identify the root cause, outline the steps taken to resolve it, and propose corrective and preventative measures.

## Scenario
For this project, I created a fictional scenario of a web application experiencing intermittent slowdowns due to a bug causing excessive memory consumption. The postmortem delves into the timeline of events, root cause analysis, resolution steps, and future preventive measures.

## Project Structure
- `0x19-postmortem/README.md`: This file contains the summary of the postmortem project.
- `0x19-postmortem/postmortem.md`: The detailed postmortem document for review.
- Other relevant files or resources may be included as needed.
